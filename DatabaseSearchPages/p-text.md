The Southern Patriot was a progressive southern newspaper that ran from from 1942-1973 out of South Carolina. The newspaper supported and advocated desegregation before and after the Civil Rights Movement. It covered groups like the militant-leaning Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in a favorable light. It covered the youth movements, sit-ins, and acts of civil disobedience surrounding the Civil Rights Movement and inspired activists in their endeavors.</p>

<p class="lead">The video collection indexing project lists titles, event names, and names found in videos, subjects, and summaries of each video. This is a wonderful source for people researching Valosta State University. Our indexing project is ongoing. We will add new records at the end of each semester. These records were created by the volunteer VSU history student workers who were working in the Archives for their history classes. We are very grateful to these workers. Please contact us if you have any questions.</p>
